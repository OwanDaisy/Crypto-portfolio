# Crypto-portfolio
This is an Excel spreadsheet i created that tracks the value of cryptocurrency holdings with live pricing data obtained using power query and an API Call(to coingecko API). Several functions were used such as The LOOKUP function and formatting tools. I proceeded to create a dashboard displaying the percentages of ROI for each coin type, acquisition cost with profit and loss and a tree chart showing each coin's current value in order to tell which holds the highest value.
Any ameliorations are highly welcomed.

# Crypto-portfolio
An Excel spreadsheet that tracks the value of cryptocurrency holdings with live pricing data obtained using power query and API Call(to coingecko API).
I then created a dashboard displaying the percentages of ROI for each coin type, acquisition cost with profit and loss and a tree chart showing each coin's current value I'm order to tell which holds the highest value
Any ameliorations are highly welcomed.
